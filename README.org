Bashcaster is a simple script that uses =ffmpeg= to record screencasts to videos or GIFs.  It can record the whole screen or a window.  It can optionally optimize GIFs with =gifsicle=.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END: 

Put =bashcaster.sh= wherever you want.

** Requirements

Bashcaster only works on X-based GUIs.  It should work on any Linux distro.  With some work it could probably work on other systems.

+  =ffmpeg= does all the work behind the scenes.
+  =xwininfo= is used to retrieve window dimensions.
+  =yad= shows the stop-icon tray notification and confirmation dialogs.
+  =gifsicle= optionally optimizes GIFs.

* Usage

=bashcaster.sh [OPTIONS] OUTPUT-FILE=

=OUTPUT-FILE= should end with the desired video type's extension, e.g. =.mp4= or =.gif=.

Click the stop-icon tray notification to stop recording.

*Options*
+  =-d=, =--debug=  Print debug info
+  =-h=, =--help=   I need somebody!
+ =--force=   Overwrite output file if it exists
+ =--window=  Select and record a window rather than the whole screen

+  =-c=, =--no-cursor=   Don't record mouse cursor
+ =-o=, =--optimize=    Optimize GIF with gifsicle
+ =-y=, =--no-confirm=  Don't ask for confirmation before recording

+ =-f=, =--framerate= =NUMBER=  Video framerate (default: 30)

+ =-l=, =--left= =NUMBER=  Video left edge position (default: 0)
+ =-t=, =--top=  =NUMBER=  Video top edge position (default: 0)

+ =-h=, =--height= =NUMBER=  Video height
+ =-w=, =--width=  =NUMBER=  Video width
